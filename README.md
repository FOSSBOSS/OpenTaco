# OpenTaco: Open-source taco modeling.
<pre>
  Tacos are more than food, they’re culture, geometry, heritage, and happiness wrapped in a tortilla. 
Yet, when it comes to mathematically precise taco models, printable taco files, or academically respectable taco simulations… the internet is a barren wasteland. 
What exists is often unprintable, poorly approximated, or tragically uninspired. We aim to fix that.

Introducing OPENTACO: the world’s only dedicated repository of tacos. 
Our mission is simple and noble: 
Ensure that tacos are faithfully represented in the digital realm, preserved for humanity, and shared freely with all.

We invite artists, engineers, mathematicians, dreamers, and taco enthusiasts everywhere to help craft the ultimate virtual taco. 
Tacos have united people for millennia, and if knowledge of their perfect form were ever lost… humanity would be in real trouble.

Join us. Model tacos. Save civilization. Perseurve humanities greatest achievement.
